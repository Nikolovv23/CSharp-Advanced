// You have a fast-food restaurant and most of the food that you're offering is previously prepared. You need to know if you will have enough food 
// to serve lunch to all of your customers. Write a program that checks the orders' quantity. You also want to know the client with the biggest order 
// for the day, because you want to give him a discount the next time he comes. 
// First, you will be given the quantity of the food that you have for the day (an integer number).  Next, you will be given a sequence of integers,
// each representing the quantity of order. Keep the orders in a queue. Find the biggest order and print it. You will begin servicing your clients
// from the first one that came. Before each order, check if you have enough food left to complete it. If you have, remove the order from the queue 
// and reduce the amount of food you have. If you succeeded in servicing all of your clients, print: 
// "Orders complete".
//  If not â€“ print:
// "Orders left: {order1} {order2} .... {orderN}".

// Input:                        XmlOutputMethod:      
// 348                           54
// 20 54 30 16 7 9               Orders complete
