// Write a program that keeps track of a song's queue. The first song that is put in the queue, should be the first that gets played.
// A song cannot be added, if it is currently in the queue.
// You will be given a sequence of songs, separated by a comma and a single space. After that, you will be given commands until there are no songs enqueued.
// When there are no more songs in the queue print "No more songs!" and stop the program.
// The possible commands are:
// •	"Play" - plays a song(removes it from the queue)
// •	"Add {song}" - adds the song to the queue, if it isn't contained already, otherwise print "{song} is already contained!"
// •	"Show" - prints all songs in the queue, separated by a comma and a white space (start from the first song in the queue to the last)
// Input
// •	On the first line, you will be given a sequence of strings, separated by a comma and a white space.
// •	On the next lines, you will be given commands until there are no songs in the queue.
// Output
// •	While receiving the commands, print the proper messages described above
// •	After the command "Show", print the songs from the first to the last.

// Input:                                     Output:
// All Over Again, Watch Me                   Watch Me is already contained!
// Play                                       Watch Me, Love Me Harder, Promises
// Add Watch Me                               No more songs!
// Add Love Me Harder
// Add Promises
// Show
// Play
// Play
// Play
// Play
