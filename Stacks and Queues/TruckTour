// Let’s suppose there is a circular route for lorries. There are N petrol pumps on that toute. Petrol pumps are numbered 0 to (N−1) (both inclusive). 
// You will receive information (array), corresponding to each of the petrol pumps: [0] the amount of petrol (in litres) that particular petrol pump will give,
// and[1] the distance(in kilometers) from the current petrol pump to the next petrol pump.
// You have a tank of infinite capacity carrying no petrol. Your task is to figure out, which is the first possible petrol pump, from which the lorry will be able 
// to complete the route. Consider that the lorry will stop at each of the petrol pumps. The lorry will move one kilometer for each liter of petrol.
// Input
// •	The first line will contain the value of N
// •	The next N lines will contain a pair of integers each, i.e. the amount of petrol that petrol pump will give and the distance between that petrol pump 
// and the next petrol pump.
// Output
// •	An integer which will be the smallest index of the petrol pump from which we can start the tour.

// Input:                 Output:
// 3                       1
// 1 5
// 10 3
// 3 4
